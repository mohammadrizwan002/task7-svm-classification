Task 7 - SVM Classification (ELEVATE LABS AIML INTERNSHIP JUNE-2025)

This task is part of my AI & ML internship.

Objective:
Use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify data using both linear and RBF kernels. Perform hyperparameter tuning and visualize decision boundaries using PCA.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- pandas, numpy

Steps Performed:
1. Loaded and cleaned the Breast Cancer dataset
2. Encoded labels and normalized features
3. Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels
4. Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
5. Evaluated performance with classification report and CV scores
6. Visualized decision boundary using PCA-reduced 2D data

Results:
Achieved high accuracy with tuned RBF kernel. Decision boundary showed clear separation of classes in 2D space.
